# Pokemans - gotta grab the mostly

This is a small demo app to show off some functional programming principles
in JS. I don't claim it is good code, just interesting code.

It uses the [pokeapi](http://pokeapi.co) for data.


## Installation


```bash
npm i
npm start
```

## Concepts

0. Composition
0. Currying
0. stateless functions
0. separation of stateless and stateful functions
0. Pure functions
0. No explicit looping
0. pokemans
