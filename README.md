# Pokemans - gotta grab the mostly

This is a small demo app to show off some functional programming principles
in JS.

It uses the [pokeapi](http://pokeapi.co) for data.

This is for demo purposes only. If you build real apps like this you will be
sad, but there are some core ideas to notice.


## Installation


```bash
npm i
npm start
```

## Concepts

0. Composition
0. Currying
0. stateless functions
0. separation of stateless and stateful functions
0. Pure functions
0. No explicit looping
0. pokemans
